# String Math Calculator

String Math Calculator is able to solve math calculations within a string, returning a double as the product. Supports the basic operators, *, /, + and -. Also supports parentheses, roots, exponents and logarithms. The operations are calculated left to right by PEMDAS order.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A .net framework that conforms to .net standard 2.0

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/

Windows -
.NET Framework, .NET core

Windows, Linux, Mac -
.NET core

### Installation

String Math Calculator is available to install as a Nuget package:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/StringMathCalculator/

Nuget installation instructions:

## Examples

A basic forumla, operations are performed left to right, in PEMDAS order.
```
using StringMathCalculator;

Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

//Calculate returns a double
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("3 + 8 - 9 / 7 * 6").Calculate());
```

Square root of 4. Any root can be used on the right side of r.
```
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("4 r 2").Calculate());
```

Exponent, 4 by the power of two.
```
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("4 ^ 2").Calculate());
```

Log, 4 by the log of 2.
```
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("4 log 2").Calculate());
```

Parentheses can be used
```
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("(3 + 4) * 2").Calculate());
```

The times operator can be omitted if a number is next to a parentheses 
```
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("(3 + 4) 2").Calculate());
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("2 (3 + 4)").Calculate());
```

## Custom Operations

A custom operation can be added, it just needs to take in two doubles and output a double. Choose a positive number for the weight of the operation and a character to tie the operation to. Existing operation characters cannot be reused, and the character cannot be a number. The character also cannot use the reserved characters '(', ')' or '.'.
```
calculator.AddOperation((x, y) => x + x + y + y, 3, 'f');
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("2 f 2").Calculate());
```

A word can be tied to the custom operation instead of a charcter. The word cannot be just a number, but can contain numbers.
```
calculator.AddOperation((x, y) => x + x + y, 3, "addtwice");
Console.WriteLine(calculator.Calculation("1 addtwice 3").Calculate());
```

### Weight

The weight of the operation will dictate which operation is calculated first. For example + has a weight of 1000 while * has a weight of 1001, meaning times will always be calculated before adding is considered. The highest weight is always calculated first unless parentheses are involved. The most left operation is calculated first if weights are equal.

#### Weights for existing operations

\+ 1000  
\- 1000  
\/ 1001  
\* 1001  
\^ 1002  
r 1002  
log 1002
